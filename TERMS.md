Last updated: 2025-12-10

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Discord Sound Test
bot ("the Bot"). By running or inviting the Bot to a Discord server you
represent that you have authority to bind the server and its users to these
Terms.

Scope and operator-specific notice
----------------------------------
These Terms, and the accompanying Privacy Policy in this repository, apply to
the instance of the Bot operated by the original developer under the
Discord application ID `1448050116811292853`.
If you deploy your own instance of the Bot from this repository, you are
responsible for your own operational policies and compliance; these Terms do
not impose obligations on other operators beyond the code and LICENSE
provided in this repository.

1. Limited purpose and scope
----------------------------
The Bot is provided as a prototype utility to perform short, single-user
voice tests. It is not a consumer-grade service and is provided "as is".

2. Acceptable use
-----------------
- Do not use the Bot to collect audio from users without their explicit
  consent. The Bot is designed to require an audible announcement prior to
  recording; operators must ensure they configure and run the Bot according
  to local laws and policies regarding consent and recording.
- Do not use the Bot to transmit, store, or process audio for surveillance,
  covert recording, or other activities that violate user privacy.

3. Operator responsibilities
---------------------------
- You are responsible for obtaining any necessary permissions from server
  members before recording their audio.
- You are responsible for securing the host, the `config.json` file, and any
  tokens or secrets used to operate the Bot.

4. No warranties
---------------
The Bot is provided without warranty of any kind. The authors and repository
owner disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited
to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

5. Limitation of liability
--------------------------
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and repository owner are
not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
punitive damages arising from your use of the Bot.

6. Termination
--------------
If you do not comply with these Terms, you must stop using the Bot and
remove it from any servers you operate. The repository owner may revoke
access or remove the project at their discretion.

7. Changes to the Terms
-----------------------
These Terms may be updated. The latest version in the repository is the
authoritative text.

8. Governing law
----------------
These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the repository
owner unless otherwise stated.

If you have questions about these Terms, open an issue on the project's
GitHub repository.
